# Design-Patterns
In this  assigmment our main goal was to implement different types of design patterns such as:
* Reactor - The reactor design pattern is an event handling pattern for handling service requests delivered concurrently to a service handler by one or more inputs.
  The service handler then demultiplexes the incoming requests and dispatches them synchronously to the associated request handlers.

* Singelton -  The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

* Active Object - The active object design pattern decouples method execution from method invocation for objects that each reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.

* Guard -  a guard is a boolean expression that must evaluate to true if the program execution is to continue in the branch in question.


In the Active object design patten we also implemented a save thread queue and and with this design pattern
we implemented a list of action such as :  
* Reading input from a server
* Using Caesar Cipher and transfer the input into it
* Transfer capital letters into small letters and the opposite
* And finally return to the the user all this data

## Main Goal of this project

The main goal of this project is a good and deep understanding of all the "Design Patterns" field,
At the beggigng it was a luttle bit difficulte to see implement parts  of this assigments
but after a good research we manage to complete this task.

# How to Run

In aim to compile all the file you need to write in your terminal "make all".

Now for each part in this assigment you will need to run different files:
